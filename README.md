## Summary:

As a result, we have the webpage with filters of the UFO data. You can search by date, the city, state, country and shape at the same time.

However, a drawback of this new design is that you cannot export the filtered data in excel of PDF file. I would recomend to add a new button "download as an excel of PDF" the search result. My second recommendation is to add pictures of shapes of UFO Sightings.
